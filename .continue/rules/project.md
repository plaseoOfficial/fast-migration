# Session start: sync the working branch with master

**At the start of every new chat, before doing other work, bring the current
working branch up to date with `master`:**

```bash
git fetch origin --quiet && git merge origin/master --no-edit
```

This branch (`page-finish` and friends) regularly falls behind `origin/master`,
where finished pages get merged (e.g. the `/ueber-uns` page lived only on master
and 404'd locally until merged in). Catching up first prevents "page is missing
/ shows 404" confusion and avoids rebuilding work that already exists on master.

- If the merge reports conflicts, **stop and ask the user** how to resolve them
  rather than guessing.
- **Skip this only if the user explicitly says so in their first message** of the
  chat (e.g. "don't merge master", "kein merge"). Otherwise always do it.

# Project: Fast Systemmöbel — modular section library

This repo is a **pixel-perfect clone of Fast Systemmöbel**, built as **one modular
section library** shared by every page. **Before building or changing any page,
read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[`docs/sections/CATALOG.md`](docs/sections/CATALOG.md), and browse the `/library` route.**

Core rules (full detail in `ARCHITECTURE.md`):
- **Pixel-perfect.** When refactoring existing sections, keep the rendered markup/CSS
  byte-identical — change only content (via props), never classes/styles/spacing/colors.
  Verify with `npm run check` + a visual diff vs `docs/design-references/`.
- **Design system & QC.** The token contract (colors, type, spacing, radii, shadows,
  component specs) lives in **[`docs/design-system/TOKENS.md`](docs/design-system/TOKENS.md)**.
  After building or changing UI (`src/components/**`, `src/app/globals.css`), run the
  read-only **`design-qc`** agent (`.claude/agents/design-qc.md`) — it flags every
  deviation from the design system with `file:line` + a concrete fix.
- **Sections live in** `src/components/sections/{home,privat,shared,gewerbe,moebelplaner,kontakt}`
  plus `_shared/` primitives. Reusable sections (home/privat/shared) are **props-driven**;
  their copy lives in content modules under `src/lib/content/`.
- **Reuse before creating.** Every section is registered in `src/lib/sections/registry.ts`
  with a `useCase` + `category`. Check `/library` / `CATALOG.md` first; match by use case.
- **Site chrome (nav + footer) is centralized.** Create every public page inside the
  `(site)` route group (`src/app/(site)/<slug>/page.tsx`); `src/app/(site)/layout.tsx`
  renders the shared `Header` + `Footer` automatically, so new pages get identical
  chrome with no wiring. Pages only return their own `<main>`. The internal `/library`
  showcase stays **outside** the group and chrome-free.
- **New "Privat" (residential service) page** = create under `(site)`, wrap sections in
  `PrivatPageLayout` (now just `<main>`), follow the Privat Page Recipe in `CATALOG.md`,
  content in `src/lib/content/<slug>.ts`.
- **New section** → add the component + register it in `registry.ts` + `catalog-data.ts`,
  then run `npm run gen:catalog`.
- **New page added?** Consult **[`docs/seo/internal-linking.md`](docs/seo/internal-linking.md)** (the
  silo-model link backlog) and wire every internal link whose target now exists, in both directions.
  We launch *clean* — no dead links; flat URLs (`/moebel-nach-mass/` → `/kuechen-nach-mass/`, …).
  The model is **machine-readable** in **[`src/lib/seo/linking-rules.ts`](src/lib/seo/linking-rules.ts)**
  (page graph + MUSS/SOLL/DARF-NICHT + anchor sets); register the new page's node there
  (`built: true`, `parent`, `type`). Run **`npm run audit:links`** to check the real link graph
  (dead links, missing MUSS, cross-silo, budgets, anchor diversity), and use the **`intern-verlinkung`**
  agent (`.claude/agents/intern-verlinkung.md`) to insert links + find anchors.

# Website Reverse-Engineer Template

## What This Is
A reusable template for reverse-engineering any website into a clean, modern Next.js codebase using AI coding agents. The Next.js + shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 base is pre-scaffolded — just run `/clone-website <url1> [<url2> ...]`.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Radix primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, `cn()` utility)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (default — will be replaced/supplemented by extracted SVGs)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch design tokens
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint check
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript check
- `npm run check` — Run lint + typecheck + build

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Named exports, PascalCase components, camelCase utils
- Tailwind utility classes, no inline styles
- 2-space indentation
- Responsive: mobile-first

## Design Principles
- **Pixel-perfect emulation** — match the target's spacing, colors, typography exactly
- **No personal aesthetic changes during emulation phase** — match 1:1 first, customize later
- **Real content** — use actual text and assets from the target site, not placeholders
- **Beauty-first** — every pixel matters

## MOST IMPORTANT NOTES
- When launching Claude Code agent teams, ALWAYS have each teammate work in their own worktree branch and merge everyone's work at the end, resolving any merge conflicts smartly since you are basically serving the orchestrator role and have full context to our goals, work given, work achieved, and desired outcomes.
- After editing `AGENTS.md`, run `bash scripts/sync-agent-rules.sh` to regenerate platform-specific instruction files.
- After editing `.claude/skills/clone-website/SKILL.md`, run `node scripts/sync-skills.mjs` to regenerate the skill for all platforms.

# Website Inspection Guide

## How to Reverse-Engineer Any Website

This guide outlines what to capture when inspecting a target website via Chrome MCP or browser DevTools.

## Phase 1: Visual Audit

### Screenshots to Capture
- [ ] Every distinct page — desktop, tablet, mobile
- [ ] Dark mode variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Light mode variants (if applicable)
- [ ] Key interaction states (hover, active, open menus, modals)
- [ ] Loading/skeleton states
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Error states

### Design Tokens to Extract
- [ ] **Colors** — background, text (primary/secondary/muted), accent, border, hover, error, success, warning
- [ ] **Typography** — font family, sizes (h1-h6, body, caption, label), weights, line heights, letter spacing
- [ ] **Spacing** — padding/margin patterns (look for a scale: 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- [ ] **Border radius** — buttons, cards, avatars, inputs
- [ ] **Shadows/elevation** — card shadows, dropdown shadows, modal overlay
- [ ] **Breakpoints** — when does the layout shift? (inspect with DevTools responsive mode)
- [ ] **Icons** — which icon library? custom SVGs? sizes?
- [ ] **Avatars** — sizes, shapes, fallback behavior
- [ ] **Buttons** — all variants (primary, secondary, ghost, icon-only, danger)
- [ ] **Inputs** — text fields, textareas, selects, checkboxes, toggles

## Phase 2: Component Inventory

For each distinct UI component, document:
1. **Name** — what would you call this component?
2. **Structure** — what HTML elements / child components does it contain?
3. **Variants** — does it have different sizes, colors, or states?
4. **States** — default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error, empty
5. **Responsive behavior** — how does it change at different breakpoints?
6. **Interactions** — click, hover, focus, keyboard navigation
7. **Animations** — transitions, entrance/exit animations, micro-interactions

### Common Components to Look For
- Navigation (top bar, sidebar, bottom bar)
- Cards / list items
- Buttons and links
- Forms and inputs
- Modals and dialogs
- Dropdowns and menus
- Tabs and segmented controls
- Avatars and user badges
- Loading skeletons
- Toast notifications
- Tooltips and popovers

## Phase 3: Layout Architecture

- [ ] **Grid system** — CSS Grid? Flexbox? Fixed widths?
- [ ] **Column layout** — how many columns at each breakpoint?
- [ ] **Max-width** — main content area max-width
- [ ] **Sticky elements** — header, sidebar, floating buttons
- [ ] **Z-index layers** — navigation, modals, tooltips, overlays
- [ ] **Scroll behavior** — infinite scroll, pagination, virtual scrolling

## Phase 4: Technical Stack Analysis

- [ ] **Framework** — React? Vue? Angular? Check `__NEXT_DATA__`, `__NUXT__`, `ng-version`
- [ ] **CSS approach** — Tailwind (utility classes), CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion, vanilla CSS
- [ ] **State management** — Redux (check DevTools), React Query, Zustand, Pinia
- [ ] **API patterns** — REST, GraphQL (check network tab for `/graphql` requests)
- [ ] **Font loading** — Google Fonts, self-hosted, system fonts
- [ ] **Image strategy** — CDN, lazy loading, srcset, WebP/AVIF
- [ ] **Animation library** — Framer Motion, GSAP, CSS transitions only

## Phase 5: Documentation Output

After inspection, create these files in `docs/research/`:
1. `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` — All extracted colors, typography, spacing
2. `COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md` — Every component with structure notes
3. `LAYOUT_ARCHITECTURE.md` — Page layouts, grid system, responsive behavior
4. `INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md` — Animations, transitions, hover states
5. `TECH_STACK_ANALYSIS.md` — What the site uses and our chosen equivalents
